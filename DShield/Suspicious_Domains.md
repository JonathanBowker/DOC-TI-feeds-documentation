## DShield: Internet Storm Center

The ISC provides a free analysis and warning service to thousands of Internet
users and organizations, and is actively working with Internet Service Providers
to fight back against the most malicious attackers.

### Suspicious Domains

There are many suspicious domains on the internet. In an effort to identify
them, as well as false positives, we have assembled weighted lists based on
tracking and malware lists from different sources. ISC is collecting and
categorizing various lists associated with a certain level of sensitivity.
